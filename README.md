### Hello, friends ðŸ‘‹

I'm Peter. Nice to meet ya.

### ðŸ“ˆ Data science + machine learning ðŸ“Š

I largely help social sector organizations get their data into a shape where machine learning can be valuable. Much of this work ends up on [drivendata.org](https://www.drivendata.org), where you can [join a competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/) to help these organizations, learn from interesting data, try new methods, and make friends that care about impact. Here are some cool recent ones:

 - [Detect building heights and angles in satellite imagery](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/78/overhead-geopose-challenge/)
 - [Predict who is likely to get a flu vaccination](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/)
 - [Identify memes that are "hateful" based on both the text and the image](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/64/hateful-memes/)
 - [Forecast geomagnetic solar storms](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/73/noaa-magnetic-forecasting/)

Competitions are great, but not every problem is a good fit, so our team of data scientists and software engineers also works with organizations directly to analyze data, build data systems, setup pipelines, train machine learning models, and design and deploy solutions. Check out [DrivenData Labs](https://www.drivendata.co/) to learn more. There I [write case studies](https://www.drivendata.co/projects.html), [publish on our blog](https://www.drivendata.co/blog.html), and [maintain our open source work](https://www.drivendata.co/open-source.html).

### âœ¨ Open source ðŸ“¦

You can find me working on open source projects that are tools for data scientists and engineers using Python. I particularly care about reproducible data science and machine learning and AI ethics. 

See below for the projects I regularly contribute to!
